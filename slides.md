### What is this all about?

--

- It's a summer school...

--

(but tell that to the Seattle weather)

--

- ...but also an (un)conference...

--

- ...and, lest we forget, a *hackathon*

---

### So we will be...

--

- ... learning

--

- ... telling each other about our research

--

- ... and hacking together!

---

### It's inspired by a few other events

--

- [Astrohackweek](http://astrohackweek.org/)

--

- [Brainhack](http://brainhack.org)

--

- [Code Neuro](http://codeneuro.org/)

--

- [DataKind datadives](http://www.datakind.org/)

--

- and many others...

### A few words about "data science"

What's that?

---

### This is a bit of an experiment

--

- Based on the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry-based_learning">Inquiry-based learning</a>

--

- The hypothesis : learning by doing is fun and effective

--

(but <a href="http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf">might not work for novices</a>)

--

- Diversity of backgrounds and expertise can be challenging in traditional learning settings, but is helpful in inquiry-based learning.

--

(we welcome suggestions on measurements we should be making to test these hypotheses)

---

### So...

- Have fun!

--

- Ask questions!

--

- Meet new people!

--

- We're all here to learn!

### Now some of you might be thinking

--

- "I don't belong here"

--

- "I am not a great programmer at all"

--

- "I don't know enough about neuroscience yet to make a new contribution"

--

- "When they figure out, they probably won't want to work with me"

--
### (please) banish these thoughts!

# Let's introduce ourselves

Name, where from, one point of expertise

"I am Ariel Rokem; I am a data scientist at the University of Washington, in Seattle; I know how to analyze diffusion MRI data"
